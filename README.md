Dynamic Memory Allocator (Professor Rahul Garg) (November, 2020 - December, 2020) : Developed a JAVA code 
which simulates the method by which memory is allocated to various tasks in our computer systems. This was done using 
extensive property of Java abstraction and decreasing time complexity(from worst to best) as we implemented it using 
Doubly Linked List, Binary Search Tree and fnally using AVL Tree(O(log n) complexity).
